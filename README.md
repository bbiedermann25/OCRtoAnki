# Optical Character Recognition to Anki Flashcards

This is my (mediocre developer) attempt at using optical character recognition in order to quicky create csv files that can be imported into Anki. As someone trying to lean a new language I am hoping this can become a quick and effortless way to learn new vocab words.

The book I will be using is Korean Essential Vocabulary 6000 by Lee Jae Wook (이재욱).

## Goals
Given an image (file format not decided yet) grab the target language word and English definition and store in a csv file

### Example

#### Input
(todo) add image input example

#### Output
| 한국어 | English |
|-------|---------|
| 재능 | talent |
| 재다 | measure;weigh |
| 재료 | material |
